#Shortener

A super simple, Sinatra base, Redis backed URL shortener designed to be deployed on Heroku.

There are a couple branches:

* Simple data just stores every URL/short as a key-value pair.
* Complex Data stores the a hash of information about the URL in question.
* Stylish brings in the Twitter Boostrap and some jQuery.
* Simple auth wants to bring some very basic & low tech authorization to adding shortenings.

The master branch is basically stylish, since we all love some style.
