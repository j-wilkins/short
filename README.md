#Shortener

A super simple, Sinatra based, Redis backed URL shortener designed to be deployed on Heroku.


Check it out [here](http://shortener1.heroku.com), but be aware that the css on the add page that displays the shortened link assumes you're using a short url, so it kind of looks like shit when it displays `http://shortener1.heroku.com/whatev`

:edit: the version ^ there is an oldy but a goody. There's been a lot of feature creep since then which would muck up a demo. Very soon there will be a way to disable said feature creep and we'll get a new demo.
